Solve Linear equation in LU decomposition in python

While studying Linear Algebra, I wanted to solve equation in programing.
and I googled and found out some ways. 
LU decomposition is faster algorithm than Gauss-Jordan elimination, which you used to it with hand computation.


## About

Linear equation is expressed in this form: 

Ax = b

A is decomosed by L,U

A = LU

equation can be written,

LUx = b

Let y 
Ux = y,

equation separate

Ly = b
Ux = y

### L,U decomposition

### L Forward, U Backward 

### program
