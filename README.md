Solve Linear equation in LU decomposition in python

While studying Linear Algebra, I wanted to solve equation in programing.
and I googled and found out some ways. 
LU decomposition is faster algorithm than Gauss-Jordan elimination, which you used to it with hand computation.

For deatails I writed in evernote because README cannnot display mathematical expression.
